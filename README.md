# barsKmeans
kmeans algorithm to minimize walking time on bar crawls
Map Clustering Project.
My friends are coming to town and want an exciting Austin bar crawl. I will show them a good time.

Problem: I rarely go out. Not to mention, I'm new to Austin. I'm socially fresh in this city.

How will my knowledge of algorithms save me this time?
